- Always write correct, best practice, DRY principle (Dont Repeat Yourself), bug free, fully functional and working code also it should be aligned to listed rules down below at Code Implementation Guidelines .
- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo’s, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Ensure code is complete! Verify thoroughly finalised.
- Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components.
- Be concise Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.

### Coding Environment
The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
- using pnpm
- ReactJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- HTML
- CSS
- icons from lucide-react
- i18n file is under ./locales
- use zh-tw as possible when translate i18n
- react-hot-toast

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.

## File Location
- `src/locales/en.json` (English)
- `src/locales/zh.json` (Traditional Chinese)

## Basic Usage
